Contributions are welcome through GitHub issues and pull requests.

By intentionally submitting a contribution, you agree that it is provided
under Apache License 2.0 unless the file is explicitly governed by another

material that you do not have the right to redistribute.

Before opening a pull request:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and the applicable rules under `.agents/`.
2. Run `Tools/godot/Verify-GodotProject.ps1`.
3. Add new media or binary files to
   `Tools/public-release/asset-provenance.json` with verifiable provenance.
4. Update `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and the dependency manifest for new
   third-party dependencies.
5. Keep gameplay, visual, and Editor manual QA status explicit; automated
   tests do not convert a human acceptance item to passed.

Security reports must follow `SECURITY.md` rather than a public issue.
